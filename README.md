# Welcome to the Lock-In Factory

This repository is documentation of my attempt to build a social accountability application that takes advantage of the observer effect and positive peer pressure to encourage you to chase down the things you actually want to do, with documentation of your journey every step of the way.

Currently, I have an MVP that handles authentication and redirects to a skeleton of what I want the home page to look like. I'm currently working on developing the backend to handle the socialization and management of lock-ins.
